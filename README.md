# Portfolio</br>
This is just a general location for various projects I have personally made and developed. Below is a general overview of each project, and the goals of them.

<strong>Large / Group Projects</strong>

Baldurs Gate 3 Mod, Bard Subclass:</br>

Goals: The main goal of developing this mod, was a pure passion project. I was forced to learn how to mod for a game that was brand new, and had little to no modding support out there. This is a project I am very proud of, as it adds one of my favorite subclasses from Dungeons and Dragons (The Tabletop game which Baldurs Gate 3 is based off of) into the game for any players to use. The mod as of this post has over 8,600 unique downloads, and continues to grow each day.</br>

DM-Toolbox:</br>

Goals: To work with C#, and .Net framework windows forms app to create an all-in-one tool designed specifically for dungeon masters to manage and run tabletop role-playing game (RPG) encounters. With its intuitive and user-friendly interface, the DM-Toolbox offers a wide range of features to help streamline the DM's work. This project was made in a group of 5 students, and was a semester long project.</br>

Unreal Project:</br>
Unreal Metaverse Project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRQvEl1HOU Relevant time stamps: 0:00 - 2:01 | 7:58 - 11:52</br>
Unreal Metaverse Project Files: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iQJSIkLVk3C22kAa2zpzek-fN_vRyP64 </br>
Goals: To learn and explore Unreal Engine 5.1, and the Unreal Engine pipeline. A large focus of this project was to be a proof of concept project for a research team at Vanderbuilt University, that Unreal Engine could provide and meet the wants and needs of their research project. The goal of their research project, is to bring high detail virtual connections into the hands of elderly people around the world. This way, if they can't meet their loved one in person, they can instead put on a VR headset, and see the metahuman of their loved ones in real time. The team was initially working in Unity, however the models were not of enough detail for their projects focus, and that is where myself, and my team members came in. Our goal was to show that using UE 5.1 Metahumans, you could have detailed, hyper-realistic virtual recreations of ourselves. At the end of the day, we did this by making multiple short films that simply try to showcase some of the possibilities of using the Unreal Engine pipeline, and presented it all in a youtube video, that is linked above.

Survey System:</br>
Link to Survey-System Github: https://github.com/KyleDuBray/survey-system </br>
Goals: The goal of this project was to work with SQL, PHP, CSS, and JS to create a website that allows a user to create and take surveys or forms, that a user made. The main purpose of this is to allow a user to create a question based form containing multiple choice questions, and text response questions, that they can send to clients, friends, or a community to see the general sentiment and or success rate of the users that take the their form. This project was created with a group of 4 students in the course of around 2 weeks.

WebCastleProject:</br>
Goals: The goal of this project was to work with OpenGL, in a team environment, to just create a very simplistic 3d environment, with a little bit of animation and sound. Another big goal of this project was to allow the user toe easily manipulate the camera, to move around, and explore the 3d castle that was created.

<strong> Smaller learning based projects </strong>

Project 1: Dynamic Memory Allocation [C++]</br>
Goals: To demonstrate basic usage of pointer, dynamic memory allocation, reading and writing files, and using value-returning functions.

Project 3: Ordered Singly-Linked List Template [C++] </br>
Goals: To show usage of singly linked list, templates, and ordering singly linked list with custom objects.

Project 4: The Maze [C++]</br>
Goals: To demonstrate usage of recursion, and the use of backtracking exclusively to solve a problem.

Project 5: Word Tree [C++]</br>
Goals: To further use and understand recursion, and mainly to implement and show a use of binary search trees.

ASM Project 1: Basic Assembly [ASM]</br>
Goals: To demonstrate basic understanding of x86_64 assembly language usage, and creating a basic function, loop, and working with an array within it.

HTML Project 1: The Locations of Singapore [HTML/CSS] </br>
Goals: To demonstrate basic understanding of CSS and HTML. The website provided, is meant to be a clean and easy to navigate website discussing the various locations and attractions of Singapore.
