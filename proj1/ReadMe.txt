Objectives: 1) Use pointers; 2) Dynamically allocate memory; 3) Read and write files; 4) Use value-returning functions.
Project description:

In this assignment you will have the opportunity to recall what you’ve previously learned about pointers, value returning
functions, and file processing. You will write a small program that simulates just in time memory allocation, by
dynamically allocating an array, and then reallocating it as the size of the input reaches the array’s capacity.
